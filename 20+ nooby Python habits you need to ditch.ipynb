    "## Title: Breaking Bad Python Habits: 20+ Noob Traps to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Python, with its clean syntax and versatility, can often seduce newcomers into some less-than-optimal coding habits that are obvious indicators that one is a nooby, especially during interviews. For this purpose, I've found this cool youtube video about a common habits that can give away that you are a nooby and simple ways to improve it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUeud6DvOWI).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, all these bad habits may seem innocent at first glance, but they can lead to code that's harder to maintain, less efficient, and prone to errors. Some of these are actual issues for your code, but a lot of them don't actually matter much. Nevertheless these things will tip people off to your inexperience in Python programing. So, whether you're an actual noob looking to get better, or if you just want to catch any newbie habits that you still hold onto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into these common pitfalls and learn how to break free from them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manual String Formatting:** Instead of manually formatting strings with concatenation or the `%` operator, embrace f-strings or the `format()` method for cleaner and more readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manually Closing Files:** Utilize context managers (`with` statement) to automatically close files after operations, ensuring proper resource management and avoiding potential memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using \"try:\" and \"finally:\" Instead of a Context Manager:** Context managers provide a cleaner and more concise way to handle resources compared to using `try` and `finally` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using a Bare \"except:\" Clause:** Be specific with exception handling to catch only the expected errors and avoid masking bugs by catching all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Misunderstanding \"^\" Operator:** Remember that in Python, `^` represents bitwise XOR, not exponentiation. For exponentiation, use `**`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Default Mutable Arguments:** Avoid using mutable objects as default arguments in function definitions, as they can lead to unexpected behavior due to shared references.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Underusing Comprehensions:** Leverage list, dictionary, and set comprehensions for concise and efficient code instead of verbose loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Overusing Comprehensions:** While comprehensions can improve readability, avoid excessive nesting or complexity that may reduce code clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Checking Type with \"==\":** Use `isinstance()` for type checking instead of comparing types with `==`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Using \"==\" to Check None, True, or False:** Utilize `is` or the truthiness of objects (`if x is None` or `if x` for None, True, or False checks).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Redundant Boolean Checks:** Simplify boolean expressions by directly using the object in the condition (`if x` instead of `if bool(x)` or `if len(x)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Using \"range(len(a))\" Idiom:** Prefer iterating over elements directly (`for item in a`) instead of relying on indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Looping Over Dictionary Keys:** Utilize dictionary methods like `items()` or `keys()` directly or use dictionary comprehensions for clearer code.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Ignoring Dictionary Methods:** Familiarize yourself with dictionary methods like `items()`, `keys()`, and `values()` for efficient manipulation of dictionary contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Underutilizing Tuple Unpacking:** Take advantage of tuple unpacking to simplify assignments and function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Creating Custom Index Counters:** Instead of managing index counters manually in loops, utilize `enumerate()` for cleaner and more Pythonic code.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Using \"time.time()\" for Timing:** Use `timeit` module or higher-level profiling tools for accurate and detailed performance measurements instead of `time.time()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **Excessive Print Statements:** Employ the `logging` module for more robust logging and debugging capabilities instead of scattering print statements throughout your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Unsafe Use of \"shell=True\" in subprocess:** Avoid security risks associated with shell injection by setting `shell=False` or using the safer `subprocess.run()` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **Performing Data Analysis in Python:** While Python is capable of data analysis, consider utilizing specialized libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or SciPy for more efficient and robust data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Reckless Use of \"import *\":** Opt for explicit imports to enhance code readability, avoid namespace pollution, and facilitate better code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Rigid Dependency on Directory Structure:** Write code that's adaptable to different project structures, making it easier to reuse and maintain across various environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Misconception About Python Compilation:** Understand that Python is indeed compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the Python interpreter, dispelling the common myth that Python is purely interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Neglecting PEP 8 Guidelines:** Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for consistent and readable Python code, promoting collaboration and codebase maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking free from these novice habits will not only improve your Python coding skills but also lead to more efficient, maintainable, and reliable software projects. By embracing best practices and continuously refining your coding techniques, you'll elevate your proficiency as a Python developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, this is not an exhaustive list, and there might be exceptions or specific contexts where some practices are acceptable. The key is to be aware of these common pitfalls and strive for clean, efficient, and maintainable code as you progress in your Python journey."

    "Let's break down each point and show the practices with code examples for each point:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manual String Formatting:** Instead of using the plus sign to concatenate strings, use f-strings.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   greeting = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Good\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manually Closing a File:** Utilize a `with` statement to automatically close files.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "   file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Good\n",
    "   with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "       file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using \"try-finally\" Instead of a Context Manager:** Utilize context managers directly instead of using `try` and `finally`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       contents = file.read()\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Good\n",
    "   with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "       contents = file.read()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using a Bare \"except\" Clause:** Avoid using bare `except` clauses, be specific about the exceptions you catch.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       some_operation()\n",

    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       handle_value_error()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Thinking \"^\" Means Exponentiation:** This is super nooby, but just in case. Use `**` for exponentiation, not `^`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   result = 2 ^ 3  # Bitwise XOR\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Good\n",
    "   result = 2 ** 3  # Exponentiation\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   def append_to_list(value, my_list=[]):\n",
    "       my_list.append(value)\n",
    "       return my_list\n",
    "\n",

    "       my_list.append(value)\n",
    "       return my_list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Never Using Comprehensions:** Utilize comprehensions for shorter and clearer code.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   squares = []\n",
    "   for i in range(5):\n",
    "       squares.append(i ** 2)\n",

    "   # Good\n",
    "   squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(5)]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Always Using Comprehensions:** Avoid excessive use of comprehensions if it makes the code less readable.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad\n",
    "   data = {i: i ** 2 for i in range(10)}\n",
