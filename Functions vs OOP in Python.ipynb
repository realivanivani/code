    "The foundation of clean and maintainable data science code lies in well-designed functions. These functions act as the building blocks of your programs, ensuring readability, reusability, and ultimately, better data science! In this blog post, we'll unveil 7 golden rules for crafting effective functions, drawing inspiration from a recent video by name of the Youtube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatgY4NpZXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatgY4NpZXE). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule emphasizes the importance of focus. Each function should ideally perform a single, well-defined task. This promotes clarity and reduces the potential for errors. Imagine a function tasked with wrangling and cleaning a messy dataset. Refactoring this function into smaller, specialized functions – one to handle missing values, another for data type conversions – would significantly improve readability and maintainability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll explore the separation of concerns between queries and commands. A function should either retrieve data (query) or modify it (command), but not both. This principle is especially valuable in data science, where exploratory analysis often involves retrieving and visualizing data. By separating these tasks, our code becomes more modular and easier to test. Stay tuned for the next part, where we'll delve into more tips for writing well-designed functions and conquer the wild world of data with confidence!"
