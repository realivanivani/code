    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "Lists and tuples are both fundamental data structures in Python, but they have some key differences. Lists are mutable, which means that you can change their contents after they have been created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, which means that their contents cannot be changed after they have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "* Lists are dynamic and mutable, tuples are immutable. \n",
    "* Lists are ideal for scenarios requiring frequent element insertion and deletion, whereas tuples excel in scenarios where elements remain constant.\n",
    "* Lists has several building functions, while tuples lack built-in methods.\n",
    "* Thus, tuples are faster and use less memory, while slower than tuples.\n",
    "* Lists are noted with a squared brackets like this [ ], while tuples are noted with regular brackets like this ( )\n",

    "## 5. Monkey Patching in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the advanced Python techniques and responsible coding practices. By explaining the concept of monkey patching and its core principles, and discussing valid use cases and potential drawbacks, you demonstrate your awareness of advanced Python leaving a strong impression in your Python interview. It is important to show understanding of methods like context managers and decorators for cleaner patching implementations, and emphasize responsible patching practices to avoid code confusion and maintainability issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"monkey patching\" refers to a dynamic technique that allows you to modify the behavior of code at runtime. This means you can change how a function, class, or even a built-in module operates without altering its original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching leverages Python's dynamic nature. You essentially trick the code into believing the modified version represents the original. This can be achieved through various techniques like re-assigning attributes, replacing methods, or using decorators. Consider using patching judiciously, documenting changes, and reverting them when no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a mischievous monkey swinging in and temporarily altering the behavior of something, hence the playful name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "* Use cases: While not a routine practice, there are valid reasons to use monkey patching:\n",
    "    * Testing: Temporarily alter a library's behavior to create specific test scenarios.\n",
    "    * Debugging: Isolate and fix issues by patching suspected areas.\n",
    "    * Customization: Adapt existing code to fit unique project requirements.\n",
    "* Benefits:\n",
    "    * Avoids modifying original code, potentially preserving portability and maintainability.\n",
    "    * Enables flexible experimentation and prototyping.\n",
    "* Drawbacks:\n",
    "    * Introduces complexity and fragility into your codebase.\n",
    "    * Can make debugging more challenging.\n",
    "    * Might break other code relying on the original behavior.\n",
    "* Popular patching libraries: \n",
    "    * Explore libraries like **mock** and **monkeypatch** for simplified patching mechanisms.\n",

    "## 6. Python 'with' Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the Python with statement designed for?\n",

It simplifies the code and makes it more readable by eliminating the need for explicit try-finally blocks.\n",

    "* The primary function of the with statement is to simplify resource management and automatically handle exceptions. It ensures proper clean-up of resources, even if errors occur, preventing leaks and ensuring code reliability.\n",
    "* Common resources include files, network connections, database cursors, locks, and more.\n",
    "* By automatically invoking the close method or context manager's __ exit __ method upon completion, the with statement guarantees resources are released even if exceptions are thrown.\n",
    "* This reduces boilerplate code and makes error handling cleaner than traditional try-finally blocks.\n",

    "* Case-based removal: Remove specific values considered missing (e.g., 'NA', empty strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imputation:**\n",
    "* Mean/median/mode: Fill missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column/group. Simple but may not work well for skewed data.\n",
    "* Interpolation: Use linear interpolation or other techniques to estimate missing values based on surrounding values.\n",
    "* Model-based methods: Employ predictive models (e.g., KNN, regression) to predict missing values from other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other strategies:**\n",
    "* Category encoding: Convert categorical features with missing values to numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.\n",

    "Intermediate Python Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between pass by value and pass by reference in Python?\n",
    "When you pass an argument to a function in Python, you are actually passing a copy of the argument's value. This means that any changes you make to the argument inside the function will not affect the original argument. However, if you pass a mutable object as an argument, such as a list or a dictionary, you are actually passing a reference to the object. This means that any changes you make to the object inside the function will also be reflected in the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are decorators in Python?\n",
    "Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of functions without changing their code. They are often used to add functionality such as logging, caching, or authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?\n",
    "When you create a copy of an object in Python, you are creating a new object that has the same state as the original object. However, there are two different types of copies: shallow copies and deep copies. A shallow copy creates a new object that references the same objects as the original object. A deep copy creates a new object that has its own copies of all the objects referenced by the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain generators in Python.\n",
    "Generators are a special type of function that can be used to create iterators. Iterators are objects that produce a sequence of values one at a time. Generators are more memory-efficient than lists because they only generate the values that are needed, rather than storing all of the values in memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Python Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "What is metaprogramming in Python?\n",
    "Metaprogramming is a technique for writing code that writes code. It can be used to create more flexible and dynamic programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are closures in Python?\n",
    "Closures are a combination of a function and the environment in which the function was created. The environment includes any variables that were in scope when the function was created. This allows closures to access variables even after the function has returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?\n",
    "The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism that prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time. This means that Python is not truly multithreaded, but it can still be used to write concurrent applications using techniques such as multiprocessing and asynchronous programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some of the best practices for writing clean and maintainable Python code?\n",
    "There are many best practices for writing clean and maintainable Python code. Some of the most important include using meaningful variable names, writing clear and concise code, and using comments to explain complex code."
