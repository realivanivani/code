    "Sure, here is a blog based on the video by NeetCode titled \"8 Design Patterns EVERY Developer Should Know\":\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are essentially reusable solutions to common programming problems. They help developers write more efficient, flexible, and maintainable code. The Gang of Four published a book titled \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" in 1994. This book is considered the holy grail of design patterns and discusses 23 different patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video dives into the eight design patterns that every developer should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Factory Pattern:** This pattern helps you create objects without specifying the exact type of object that will be created. It's like having a factory that can create different kinds of products based on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Builder Pattern:** This pattern allows you to create complex objects step by step. It's like building a house where you can add different components one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Singleton Pattern:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. It's like having a single source of truth for some data in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Observer Pattern (also known as Pub/Sub Pattern):** This pattern allows objects to subscribe to events and get notified when those events happen. It's like having a YouTube channel where subscribers get notified when a new video is uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterator Pattern:** This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an object sequentially without exposing the underlying implementation of the object. It's like having a remote control that allows you to change channels on a TV without having to know how the TV works internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Strategy Pattern:** This pattern allows you to dynamically change the behavior of an algorithm at runtime. It's like having a sorting algorithm that can be configured to sort numbers in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Adapter Pattern:** This pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It's like having a plug adapter that allows you to use a device with a different plug type.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Facade Pattern:** This pattern provides a simple interface to a complex system. It's like having a dashboard that allows you to control all of the features of a car without having to know how the individual components work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this blog post provides a helpful introduction to design patterns. If you're interested in learning more, I recommend checking out the book \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\" or taking the speaker's newly released object-oriented design interview course.\n",

    "## Design Patterns in Python: A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post will explore design patterns in Python, including what they are, how they are categorized, and some common code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Design Patterns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are essentially reusable solutions to common programming problems. They are not algorithms, which provide step-by-step instructions, but rather general blueprints or templates that can be applied to different situations. Design patterns help developers write cleaner, more maintainable, and more flexible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy: Birthday Party vs. Cake Recipe**\n",
    "\n",
    "The video uses a great analogy to explain the difference between a design pattern and an algorithm. Imagine you want to bake a cake for your birthday. You might follow a recipe, which is like an algorithm, providing a set of instructions to achieve a specific outcome. A design pattern, on the other hand, is more like the concept of a birthday party. Everyone has a different idea of what a birthday party entails, but we all recognize the general concept. Design patterns provide this sort of high-level structure for solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categories of Design Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gang of Four book, published in 1994, is a classic reference for design patterns. It outlines 23 design patterns, categorized into three main groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creational Design Patterns:** These patterns focus on object creation. They provide mechanisms for creating objects in a flexible and controlled manner.\n",
    "2. **Structural Design Patterns:** These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. They help us organize classes and objects to achieve desired functionality.\n",
    "3. **Behavioral Design Patterns:** These patterns focus on communication and interaction between objects. They define ways for objects to collaborate and share responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Five Commonly Used Design Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "The video highlights five design patterns that the presenter finds particularly useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strategy Pattern:** This pattern allows you to dynamically switch between different algorithms or behaviors. It's useful when you have multiple ways of achieving the same result and you want to choose the appropriate one at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a code example of the Strategy Pattern in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SortStrategy:\n",
    "  def sort(self, data):\n",
    "    raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "class BubbleSortStrategy(SortStrategy):\n",
    "  def sort(self, data):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(data) - 1):\n",
    "      for j in range(len(data) - i - 1):\n",
    "        if data[j] > data[j + 1]:\n",
    "          data[j], data[j + 1] = data[j + 1], data[j]\n",
    "\n",
    "class SelectionSortStrategy(SortStrategy):\n",
    "  def sort(self, data):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(data)):\n",
    "      min_index = i\n",
    "      for j in range(i + 1, len(data)):\n",
    "        if data[j] < data[min_index]:\n",
    "          min_index = j\n",
    "      if i != min_index:\n",
    "        data[i], data[min_index] = data[min_index], data[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "class Client:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, sort_strategy):\n",
    "    self.sort_strategy = sort_strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "  def set_sort_strategy(self, sort_strategy):\n",
    "    self.sort_strategy = sort_strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "  def sort_data(self, data):\n",
    "    self.sort_strategy.sort(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "data = [5, 2, 9, 1, 6]\n",
    "sort_strategy = BubbleSortStrategy()\n",
    "client = Client(sort_strategy)\n",
    "client.sort_data(data)\n",
    "print(data)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9]\n",

    "client.sort_data(data)\n",
    "print(data)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decorator Pattern:** This pattern lets you add new functionality to an object without modifying its original implementation. It's a great way to extend functionality without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a code example of the Decorator Pattern in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Text:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, text):\n",
    "    self.text = text\n",
    "\n",
    "  def render(self):\n",
    "    return self.text\n",
    "\n",
    "class BoldText(Text):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, text):\n",
    "    super().__init__(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "  def render(self):\n",
    "    return f\"**{self.text}**\"  # Wrap text in bold markers\n",
    "\n",
    "class ItalicText(Text):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, text):\n",
    "    super().__init__(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "  def render(self):\n",
    "    return f\"_{self.text}_\"  # Wrap text in italic markers\n",
    "\n",
    "def decorate_text(text, decorator):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Returns a decorated text object\"\"\"\n",
    "  return decorator(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "bold_text = decorate_text(text, BoldText)\n",
    "italic_text = decorate_text(text, ItalicText)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(bold_text.render())  # Output: **Hello, World!**\n",
    "print(italic_text.render())  # Output: _Hello, World!_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Factory Pattern:** This pattern helps you create objects without specifying the exact type of object that will be created. You provide a factory class that decides which concrete class to instantiate based on the provided criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a code example of the Factory Pattern in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "  def draw(self):\n",
    "    raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "class Square(Shape):\n",
    "  def draw(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Drawing a square\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "  def draw(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Drawing a circle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class ShapeFactory:\n",
    "  @staticmethod\n",
    "  def create_shape(shape_type):\n",
    "    if shape_type == \"square\":\n",
    "      return Square()\n",
    "    elif shape_type == \"circle\":\n",
    "      return Circle()\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "      raise ValueError(\"Invalid shape type\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "shape = ShapeFactory.create_shape(\"square\")\n",
    "shape.draw()  # Output: Drawing a square\n",
    "\n",
    "shape = ShapeFactory.create_shape(\"circle\")\n",
    "shape.draw()  # Output: Drawing a circle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Observer Pattern (Pub/Sub Pattern):** This pattern allows objects to subscribe to events and get notified when those events happen. It's useful for loosely coupled communication between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a code example of the Observer Pattern in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Subject:\n",
    "  def __init__(self):\n",
    "    self.observers = []\n",
    "\n",
    "  def register_observer(self, observer):\n",
    "    self.observers.append(observer)\n",
    "\n",
    "  def notify_observers(self):\n",
    "    for observer in self.observers:\n",
    "      observer.update(self)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Observer:\n",
    "  def update(self, subject):\n",
    "    raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "class WeatherStation(Subject):\n",
    "  def __init__(self):\n",
    "    super().__init__()\n",
    "    self.temperature = None\n",
    "\n",
    "  def set_temperature(self, temperature):\n",
    "    self.temperature = temperature\n",
    "    self.notify_observers()\n",
    "\n",
    "class TemperatureDisplay(Observer):\n",
    "  def update(self, subject):\n",
    "    print(f\"Temperature: {subject.temperature}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "weather_station = WeatherStation()\n",
    "temperature_display = TemperatureDisplay()\n",
    "weather_station.register_observer(temperature_display)\n",
    "\n",
    "weather_station.set_temperature(25)\n",
    "# Output: Temperature: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adapter Pattern:** This pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two classes with different interfaces by translating requests from one format to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a code example of the Adapter Pattern in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TwoPinPlug:\n",
    "  def get_electricity(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Providing electricity through two-pin plug\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class ThreePinSocket:\n",
    "  def provide_electricity(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Providing electricity through three-pin socket\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class TwoPinToThreePinAdapter(TwoPinPlug):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, three_pin_socket):\n",
    "    self.three_pin_socket = three_pin_socket\n",
    "\n",
    "  def get_electricity(self):\n",
    "    self.three_pin_socket.provide_electricity()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "two_pin_plug = TwoPinPlug()\n",
    "three_pin_socket = ThreePinSocket()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Two pin plug cannot be directly connected to three pin socket\n",
    "# two_pin_plug.get_electricity()  # Would cause an error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the adapter to connect them\n",
    "adapter = TwoPinToThreePinAdapter(three_pin_socket)\n",
    "adapter.get_electricity()  # Output: Providing electricity through three-pin socket\n",
    "```\n",
